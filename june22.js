// 1. Create a variable called output and set it to
// "Hello World!" then have it displayed in the console


// 2. Create an empty function called greeting that takes a string input
// You will pass in as the parameter your variable output that 
// You created above 


// 3. Inside your empty function, check if the input is equal to "Hello World!"
// If so concatenate with "My name is <insert your name>." and return the new value
// If it doesn't match, set the input to "Goodbye! I don't talk to strangers." and return the value

// 4. Create a new variable, call it result, and set it to the function (call the function)
// Remember to pass in your variable output into the function
// Print out the new variable value
// Reassign the variable result to call the function again, 
// but this time pass in the variable wrongOutPut that is given below


let wrongOutPut = "My name is <insert your name>.";
